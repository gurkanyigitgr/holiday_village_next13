## Technologies Used
- **Prisma**: Used for database access and querying.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database where data is stored.
- **Next.js**: React-based framework with server-side rendering (SSR) support.
- **Redux**: Used for state management.
- **TypeScript**: Programming language that provides type safety.
- **Next-Auth**: Used for authentication and authorization processes.
